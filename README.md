# Bootstrap
I love having an idea and jumping in to dev but bootstrapping is always a pain. This is a collection of libs + architecture that I like and makes it easy to clone + get jammin.

Very much a work in progress.

## Running

`docker-compose up` should build the client/server containers, start up the db, install deps, and start relevant processes.
